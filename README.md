# BasicPython
This is a Jupyter Notebook that will explain the basics of Python and give you a change to practice along.

I chose to use Jupyter Notebook because this allows the user to change to write code as it is being explain and run in along with example code.  
I used markedown in the Jupyter Notebook to help explain differents between new concepts.   
All highlighted items are outside links and if pressed will open a new tab to take you to those different links.  
I wrote this Basics Python in Py 3.7 Please let me know if anyone was able to run in a previous version.

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html" target="_blank" title="Python Documentation contents">Python Documentation</a> is the most used link in this Basic Python Notebook.
